isometric combat simulator written in Lua using LÃ¶ve2D

## Work in progress
This project is a work in progress. The goal is to create a combat simulator that can be used to test out different combat mechanics and see how they affect the outcome of a battle. The combat simulator will be isometric and will use a grid system for movement and combat.
